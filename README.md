# Lucid â€¢ Console
The Console companion for the Lucid Architecture.

## Command Line Interface
The console ships with a command line interface called `lucid` that you can find in `vendor/bin/lucid` and use as
```
lucid make:feature ListUsers Api
```

> To be able to address the `lucid` cli directly you need to have `./vendor/bin` as part of your `$PATH`.
To do that, put this in your shell profile (~/.bash_profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/bashrc) `export PATH="$PATH:./vendor/bin`"
